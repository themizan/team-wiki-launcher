# Team Wiki Launcher

This is a simple set of wrapper scripts to quickly spin up a local Realm Wiki server setup to serve the team wiki skeleton. This can be used to quickly experiment with adding a wiki for a team project. If the git url in start-wiki.sh is modified, it could be used as a way to distribute copies of team documentation locally for offline access.
